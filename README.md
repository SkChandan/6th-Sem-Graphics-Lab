<strong>PART - A</strong>
Design, develop, and implement the following programs in C / C++ <br /><br />
1. Program to recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to from 3D
Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified
by the user.
<br /><br />
2. Program to implement Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm.
<br /><br />
3. Program to draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL
transformation matrices.
<br /><br />
4. Program to create a house like figure and rotate it about a given
fixed point using OpenGL functions.
<br /><br />
5. Program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line-clipping
algorithm. Make provision to specify the input line, window for
clipping and view port for displaying the clipped image.
<br /><br />
6. Program to create a cylinder and a parallelepiped by extruding a
circle and quadrilateral respectively. Allow the user to specify the
circle and the quadrilateral.
<br /><br />
7. Program, using OpenGL functions, to draw a simple shaded scene
consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably the position and
properties of the light source along with the properties of the
properties of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.
<br /><br />
8. Program to draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera
suitably to experiment with perspective viewing. Use OpenGL
functions.
<br /><br />
9. Program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling
algorithm. (Use appropriate data structures.)
<br /><br />
10. Program to display a set of values {fij} as a rectangular mesh.
